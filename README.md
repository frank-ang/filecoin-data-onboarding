## Filecoin Large Data Onboarding Guide

This operational guide that walkthroughs the process to onboard large PiB+ size datasets into the Filecoin network. This guide is suitable for data clients and data owners.&#x20;

This guide covers the end-to-end data onboarding process, from planning, data preparation, deal making, and retrieval testing.

We walkthrough usage of the client-side tooling, primarily the [Singularity tool](https://github.com/tech-greedy/singularity), [Lotus client](https://lotus.filecoin.io/), and [Boost.](https://boost.filecoin.io/) (WIP)&#x20;

#### Looking for other tools?

For smaller datasets (<100TiB), you may consider alternatives such as: [Chainsafe.storage](https://storage.chainsafe.io/), [Estuary.tech](https://estuary.tech/),  [web3.storage](https://web3.storage), or [NFT.storage](https://nft.storage).
