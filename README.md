## Overview

Operational guide for data clients, data preparers, and lead storage providers, to onboard datasets into Filecoin storage.&#x20;

This guide covers the end-to-end data onboarding process, from planning, data preparation, deal making, and retrieval testing.

This guide assumes the client-side tool is the [Singularity tool](https://github.com/tech-greedy/singularity), integrating with [Boost](https://boost.filecoin.io/), although the general outline should also apply other tools.
