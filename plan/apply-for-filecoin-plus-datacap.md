# ðŸŽŸ Apply for Filecoin Plus DataCap

### What is DataCap?

DataCap is a cryptoeconomic incentive to Storage Providers for storing verified datasets. Clients apply for DataCap, which is reviewed by a community of Fil+ notaries. Upon approval, DataCap is allocated to the applicant's FIL wallet. DataCap is spent by the client in storage deals with storage providers. In a way, DataCap can be thought of as similar to storage credits.&#x20;

Datacap is part of the Fil+ (Filecoin Plus) programme. More info about Fil+ Plus:

### Prepare a Filecoin wallet

The wallet address will be where approved Fil+ datacap will be allocated to.&#x20;

It is recommended to use a lotus-lite node to create a wallet, and please securely backup the wallet keys. To create a Filecoin wallet on a lotus node, see [wallet instructions on lotus docs](https://lotus.filecoin.io/tutorials/lotus/store-and-retrieve/set-up/#get-a-fil-address).

### Apply for **Large Dataset Datacap Application**&#x20;

using the Large Data Notary ("LDN") application process. Apply on the [filecoin-plus-large-datasets Github repo issues](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-plus-large-datasets/issues/), click "New Issue" -> Large Dataset Notary application -> "Get Started".

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to apply for LDN using a Github account with some history of commits or repository activity, to better align with Github terms of service.
{% endhint %}

The LDN Application process can take some time for governance review by Filecoin Notaries. It is recommended to furnish as much information as is reasonable, clearly describe the use-case and the data client context, be transparent, and err on the side of over-communicating details. It is recommended to subscribe to updates to the LDN Application Github issue and respond promptly to questions from the community.

Each LDN application can support a current maximum datacap amount of 5 PiB. For datasets that exceed 5 PiB, one approach is to submit a multi-part series of LDNs.&#x20;
