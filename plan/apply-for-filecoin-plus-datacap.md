# ðŸŽŸ Apply for Filecoin Plus DataCap

### What is DataCap?

DataCap is a cryptoeconomic incentive to Storage Providers for storing verified datasets. Clients apply for DataCap and upon approval, is granted a DataCap allocation. DataCap, when allocated to a client, can be spent by the client in storage deals with storage providers. In a way, DataCap can be thought of as similar to storage credits. It is part of the Filecoin Plus programme.

### Prepare a Filecoin wallet

Create a Filecoin wallet, \[[instructions here](https://docs.filecoin.io/get-started/overview/#wallets)]. The wallet address will be where the Fil+ datacap  will be allocated to. It is highly recommended to secure and backup the private key.

### Apply for Large Dataset Notary datacap

This guide assumes a large dataset (between 500TiB to 5 PiB size, including replicas), using the Large Data Notary ("LDN") application process. Apply on the [filecoin-plus-large-datasets Github repo issues](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-plus-large-datasets/issues/), click "New Issue" -> Large Dataset Notary application -> "Get Started".

{% hint style="info" %}
It is recommended to apply for LDN using a Github account with at least several months age. It may help for the Github account to have some history of commits or repository activity. This type of Github account will better align with Github terms.
{% endhint %}

The LDN Application process can take some time for governance review by Filecoin Notaries. It is recommended to furnish as much information as is reasonable, clearly describe the use-case and the data client context, be transparent, and err on the side of over-communicating details. It is recommended to subscribe to updates to the LDN Application Github issue and respond promptly to questions from the community.
