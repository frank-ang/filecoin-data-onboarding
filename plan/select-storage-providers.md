# üè¢ Select Storage Providers

Select SPs that meet your requirements, endpoint presence in regions that match your regional replica placement requirements. For improved data availability and redundancy, plan for multiple replicas.

SPs can be selected from multiple sources:

* Filecoin Plus Registry of miners [https://plus.fil.org/miners](https://plus.fil.org/miners)
* Filgram [https://filmine.io/filgram?type=active](https://filmine.io/filgram?type=active)
* Starboard Ventures SPRD (Storage Provider Reputation Dashboard) [https://sprd.starboard.ventures/](https://sprd.starboard.ventures/)
* Ask for suggestions on Filecoin Slack. [https://filecoin.io/slack/](https://filecoin.io/slack/)

Organizations seeking to delegate the data preparation and deal making tasks, can select a Lead SP to handle the data onboarding as a "white-glove" service and single point of coordination to distribute data replicas with other participating SPs.
