### For Data Owners

Congratulations for completing a large data onboarding to Filecoin!&#x20;

Assess the success of your Filecoin data onboarding Proof-of-Concept (POC). Determine which additional datasets are suitable candidates for follow-on data onboarding projects.

Consider becoming a Filecoin Case Study. &#x20;

#### Deal Renewal

Storage deals are currently limited to 540 days. Deals that are less than 540 days duration can simply be extended, with sector extension. More typically, verified storage deals can be expected to use the maximum 540-day duration, beyond this expiry, deal renewal requires proposing new deals and re-sealing sectors.

The current process to renew deals is to simply re-apply for DataCap for new deals, and for Storage providers to re-seal the data.

{% hint style="info" %}
Storage deal renewals is an evolving space. Some notable work in-progress include:

* Extending maximum storage deal duration up to 5 years.&#x20;
* Filecoin Virtual Machine, enabling smart contracts, which can potentially be used to implement data storage renewal and Data DAOs.

### For Data Brokers and Lead Storage Providers

Successful data onboarding projects gives the Lead SP / Data Broker greater experience, competence, and efficiency to onboard a greater volume of datasets to Filecoin.&#x20;

Consider setting up a repeatable data onboarding service, and consider commercial models for such a service.
